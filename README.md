# TWITTER FAKE ACCOUNT DETECTION PROJECT
Fake/Bot Detection in Twitter Accounts: In twitter there are multiple fake/bot accounts used by various political parties or organisation for there benefits. Can you develop an algorithm to detect the fake/bot accounts using some of the properties/features of fake/bot accounts? It will help to us to use the data from real accounts in multiple analysis.

## Description
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to detect fake Twitter accounts. It includes datasets, scripts, and documentation necessary to understand and replicate the detection process.

# How do I detect a Fake/bot Account?
Now you know what a bot is, but the bigger question is would you know a bot if you encountered one? Depending on the level of stealth employed by a bot, some are easier to detect than others.
* Some typical characteristics of bots on Twitter include:
* Many Twitter bots have a relatively recent creation date.
* Many bot user names contain numbers, which can indicate automatic name generation.
* The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content.
* The accountâ€™s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve.
* The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers.
* Many bots tweet the same content as other users at roughly the same time. 
* Short replies to other tweets can also indicate automated behavior.
* There is often no biography, or indeed a photo, associated with bot Twitter accounts.

## Installation
Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can then set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies used in the project.

## Usage
To run the detection script, execute the following command:
python TWITTER_FAKE_ACCOUNT_DETECTION.py
For a detailed analysis, open the TWITTER FAKE ACCOUNT DETECTION.ipynb notebook in Jupyter. To do this, run:
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the TWITTER FAKE ACCOUNT DETECTION.ipynb file and open it.

## Dependencies
Python 3, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Sklearn

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Dataset/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
- `Scripts/`: Includes Python scripts for running the detection algorithms.
- `Documentation/`: Provides a detailed report and research paper on the project.

## Datasets
There are three main datasets in the `Dataset/` directory:
- `training_data.csv`: The dataset used to train the machine learning model.
- `test_data.csv`: The dataset used to test and evaluate the model's performance.
- `submission.csv`: An example of the model output result used in the Analysis.

## Scripts
The core scripts included in this repository are:
- `TWITTER_FAKE_ACCOUNT_DETECTION.py`: The main Python script that runs the detection algorithm.
- `TWITTER FAKE ACCOUNT DETECTION.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that contains detailed analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Documentation
`PROJECT REPORT.pdf` and `RESEARCH PAPER.pdf` are provided to give an overview of the methodology, research context, and findings of the project. These documents are critical for understanding the background and implications of the work.
